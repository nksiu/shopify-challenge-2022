# Welcome
Thank you for viewing my Frontend 2022 Summer Intern Challenge for Shopify!
The demo for this challenge is avaiblable here: https://shopify-2022-nksiu.netlify.app

This application used React and was deployed through Netlify.

Addtional features added: 
  - Date Picker to filter Astronomy Picture of the Day by dates
  - Like button that persists on refresh and user leaving (assuming local storage is not cleared)
  - Loading state while waiting for NASA's API to return

Features I would add in the future:
  - Collapsible text box added to each card such that the image is complimented with an explanation
  - Sorting the viewing order of images presented (e.g. by date)
